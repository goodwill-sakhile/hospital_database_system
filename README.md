Hospital Management System (Java – CLI Based)

This project is a comprehensive Java-based Hospital Management System designed to operate entirely through a Command-Line Interface (CLI). It is built with a strong focus on clean architecture, modularity, and scalability, making it both an excellent learning project and a solid backend foundation for future GUI or web-based hospital applications.

Unlike traditional hospital management software that relies heavily on user interfaces, this system prioritizes data handling, business logic, and process flow. It can efficiently store, process, and manage detailed information related to the day-to-day operations of a hospital.

Key Features

Patient Management – Register, update, and retrieve patient records including personal details, medical history, and ongoing treatments.

Doctor & Nurse Records – Manage staff information such as roles, departments, and schedules.

Emergency Triage – Log and prioritize emergency cases based on severity.

Discharge Processing – Record discharge summaries, prescriptions, and follow-up instructions.

Vaccination Tracking – Keep track of administered vaccines, patient eligibility, and due schedules.

Scheduling System – Assign and manage appointments for patients and doctors.

Insurance Management – Store insurance details, verify patient coverage, and link billing records.

Modular Architecture – Codebase is separated into models, services, repositories, CLI handlers, and utilities for better organization and maintainability.

Extensible Design – Can be easily expanded to include billing, pharmacy, laboratory, or reporting modules.

Why This Project?

This system was developed to demonstrate:

Core Java programming concepts (OOP, Collections, Exception Handling, File I/O, etc.).

Real-world software architecture practices, such as multi-package design and layered development.

Scalability – The project can evolve into a GUI or web-based application with minimal refactoring.

Practical application in healthcare IT, showcasing how technology can streamline hospital operations.

Potential Use Cases

Educational tool for students learning Java and software design patterns.

Foundation for building more complex hospital management solutions with GUI or APIs.

Demonstration project for portfolios to showcase backend development and system design skills.
